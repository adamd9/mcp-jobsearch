The candidate has experience as a senior full-stack engineer with expertise in TypeScript (TS), Node.js, and AWS, which are critical components of the job. The job emphasizes cloud architecture, specifically with AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and others, which the candidate is familiar with. The role also requires experience with serverless functions and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Serverless, AWS CDK, and Terraform, which the candidate likely has experience with given their AWS background. Additionally, the candidate's experience with big data suggests strong problem-solving and analytical skills, which are essential for the responsibilities outlined in the job description. However, the job description does not explicitly mention TypeScript, which is a key focus for the candidate. This slightly lowers the match score, as the emphasis on TypeScript is not as pronounced in the job details.

    "description": "About Us:\n\n\n\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\n\n\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\n\n\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from September 15 - December 5 and you will need to be able to work out of our SF office during this time.\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Role:\n\n\n\n\nMillions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.\n\nDuring your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship AI projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n\n\n\n\nWrite clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\nDesign & enhance the Notion AI product with new capabilities.\nDevelop, fix and debug software for across our full stack: web services, databases, applications, tools.\n\n\n\n\nQualifications:\n\n\n\n\nPursuing a bachelor's or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, or equivalent.\nPrevious internship experience ideally.\nWorking towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, or Python.\nYou find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.\nYou are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.\nThis internship will take place from September 15 - December 5 and you will need to be able to work out of our SF office during this time.\n\n\n\n\nSkills You’ll Need To Bring:\n\n\n\n\nThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\nAI enthusiast: You have built or prototyped features with AI technologies (LLMs, Embeddings, ML)\nPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\nNot ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\nEmpathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\nTeam player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\n\n\n\nNice to Haves:\n\n\n\n\nYou have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Python.\nYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\nYou have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\n\n\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\n\n\n\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

    "matchReason": "The candidate is a senior full-stack engineer with significant experience in TypeScript (TS), Node.js, and AWS, which aligns well with the job's requirements. The job emphasizes backend development using Node.js and AWS, both of which the candidate is experienced in. Additionally, the candidate's experience with big-data could be beneficial for handling the large-scale data-driven applications mentioned in the job description. While the job does not explicitly mention TypeScript, the candidate's expertise in TS is likely to be advantageous, as TypeScript is often used in conjunction with Node.js for scalable applications. The candidate's seniority and full-stack experience suggest a strong ability to contribute to the design, development, and deployment of cloud-based solutions, which is a key aspect of the role. However, the job description does not mention big-data as a primary focus, which slightly reduces the match score. Overall, the candidate's profile is a strong fit for the role, particularly in terms of the emphasis on Node.js and AWS cloud architecture.",
