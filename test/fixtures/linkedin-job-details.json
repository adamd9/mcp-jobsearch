The job description emphasizes skills in systems engineering, business analysis, and experience in Defence projects, which are not directly related to presales or AI. While the location in Canberra matches the candidate's preferred location, the role's focus on mission engineering and Defence capability development is significantly different from a presales AI role. Additionally, the requirement for a security clearance in Defence further distances the job from the candidate's profile.
