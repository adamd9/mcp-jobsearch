Firstly, the job is located in the United States, which does not align with the candidate's preference for roles in Canberra, Sydney, or remote positions within Australia. Secondly, while the candidate is focused on presales roles related to artificial intelligence, the job primarily emphasizes expertise in cybersecurity, particularly Cloud and SaaS security, which is not directly aligned with AI. Although both roles involve technical sales engineering, the specific focus areas differ significantly. Additionally, the job requires willingness to travel, which may not be suitable for a candidate seeking remote work. Therefore, the mismatch in location and the specific technical focus area results in a low match score.",
